# Making a Personal Website using Github Readme

## Steps:
Make # christinajcap.github.io (must match username)
When you make a new repository on github, it will make you set the origin as that repository using git init and other stuff lol.
need index.html


## Making changes:
in the terminal:
$ cd \<directory to local files>

use . for all new files, or just put \<filename> for a specific file
$ git add . 

when you're ready to put all the changes to a version:
$ use git commit -m "\<name of commit- anything>"

to release this version to the world:
$ git push origin main
where main is the branch we are on for now, and origin is the source we are releasing to
or 
$ git push

you will need to put your github username, and personal token for the password

check the website!!!
